# **Quiplyst FinanceOps Suite: Product Requirements Document**

## **Overview**

**What are we building?**

Quiplyst is an AI-powered, end-to-end FinanceOps platform designed to transform complex, routine financial operations into intuitive, engaging, and proactive experiences. The suite covers the entire finance ecosystem, from core dashboards and analytics to advanced automation, compliance, and futuristic innovations like metaverse collaboration and zero-UI automation.

**Why are we building it?**

Finance teams are burdened by manual processes, fragmented tools, and reactive workflows. Quiplyst aims to spark proactive clarity, automate the mundane, and deliver the right insight at the right moment—empowering teams to move faster, with confidence and delight. The platform is built to scale from mid-market to enterprise, with deep AI integration, extensibility, and a witty, human-centric brand.

**Who is it for?**

Primary users are finance managers, accountants, operations leads, and CFOs in mid-market to enterprise organizations. Secondary users include IT admins, business analysts, and external partners. The platform is device-agnostic, supporting web, mobile, and emerging interfaces (AR/VR, voice, metaverse).

## **Use Cases**

* Personalized, AI-powered dashboard: Finance manager logs in and is greeted by Mercury the mascot, who highlights urgent KPIs, trends, and actionable insights tailored to their role.  
* Automated expense submission: Employee snaps a photo of a receipt on mobile, AI categorizes and checks policy, and Mercury offers a witty confirmation before routing for approval.  
* Real-time anomaly detection: The system flags a suspicious transaction, Mercury appears with a supportive tip, and the finance lead can drill down or escalate with one click.  
* AI Copilot/Genie: CFO asks, “Genie, close the books for Q2 and send a summary to the board.” The AI orchestrates multi-step workflows, notifies stakeholders, and surfaces exceptions.  
* Compliance monitoring: Compliance officer sets up real-time controls; AI flags a GDPR risk, and Mercury guides the user through remediation steps.  
* Marketplace integration: Admin browses the app store, installs a new payroll connector, and configures it in minutes with Mercury’s onboarding tips.  
* Metaverse collaboration: Finance team joins a virtual room to review forecasts, annotate reports, and interact with 3D data visualizations, all with Mercury facilitating the session.

## **Requirements**
