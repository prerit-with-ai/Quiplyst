## **Plan A: Fully-Managed SaaS (Launch Fast, Minimal Ops)**

| Layer | Technology | Rationale |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Auth & Users** | Clerk.dev / Auth0 | Turnkey OAuth, SSO, MFA |
| **Database & API** | Supabase (Postgres \+ auto-REST/GraphQL) | Instant schema-to-API, built-in realtime |
| **UI & Admin** | Next.js \+ shadcn/ui \+ Retool | Pre-built components \+ no-code admin panels |
| **Workflows & Integrations** | Zapier / [Make.com](http://Make.com) | Drag-and-drop connectors, minimal infra |
| **Payments & Banking** | Stripe \+ Plaid | PCI-compliant rails out-of-the-box |
| **AI / ML & Search** | OpenAI \+ Pinecone | Hosted LLMs \+ managed vector DB |
| **Docs & OCR** | Cloudinary \+ OCR-Space API | SaaS-based uploads \+ OCR |
| **Realtime & Streaming** | Supabase Realtime \+ Pusher | Zero-config websockets |
| **Observability** | Sentry \+ PostHog | Hosted error & product analytics |
| **Hosting & CI/CD** | Vercel \+ GitHub Actions | Auto deploy on push |

Ops profile: \~0.1 FTE; near-zero infra budget; launch in weeks.

**Drawbacks:** Lower customization, vendor costs can scale.

## **Plan B: Hybrid “Best-of-Both” (Balance Speed & Control)**

| Layer | Technology | Rationale |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Auth & Users** | Supabase Auth \+ Casbin | Embedded in DB \+ flexible RBAC |
| **Database & API** | Hasura Cloud (GraphQL) \+ PlanetScale (MySQL) | Managed GraphQL \+ serverless scalability |
| **UI & Admin** | Next.js \+ Tailwind \+ Tooljet | Code-light UI \+ low-code admin UIs |
| **Workflows & Integrations** | n8n (hosted) \+ AWS EventBridge | Visual flows \+ event bus |
| **Payments & Banking** | Stripe \+ Railz | Managed payments \+ bank-data aggregator |
| **AI / ML & Search** | Anthropic \+ Weaviate | Alternative LLM \+ open-source vector store |
| **Docs & OCR** | Filestack \+ custom Tesseract microservice | Managed uploads \+ DIY OCR tuning |
| **Realtime & Streaming** | Ably (managed) \+ Materialize Cloud | Reliable pub/sub \+ SQL-on-stream |
| **Observability** | Grafana Cloud \+ Sentry | Metrics \+ errors, less vendor lock |
| **Hosting & CI/CD** | Netlify (front) \+ AWS Fargate \+ GitLab CI | Serverless front \+ containerized back |

Ops profile: \~0.5 FTE; moderate infra spend; launch in 1–2 months.

**Drawbacks:** Some self-hosted complexity; vendor bills taper off over time.

## **Plan C: Open-Source Self-Hosted (Maximum Control)**

| Layer | Technology | Rationale |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Auth & Users** | Keycloak \+ Casbin | Full control, no recurring fees |
| **Database & API** | PostgreSQL \+ Hasura OSS \+ Prisma | Self-hosted GraphQL \+ type-safe ORM |
| **UI & Admin** | Next.js \+ Tailwind \+ custom React Admin | Full customization, steeper dev effort |
| **Workflows & Integrations** | Apache Camel \+ [Temporal.io](http://Temporal.io) | Robust ESB \+ code-defined workflows |
| **Payments & Banking** | Stripe Connect (hosted) \+ Nordigen | Stripe for rails \+ open banking data |
| **AI / ML & Search** | Self-hosted Hugging Face Transformers \+ Milvus | Customize models \+ vector search locally |
| **Docs & OCR** | MinIO \+ Tesseract \+ OpenCV | DIY file store \+ OCR pipeline |
| **Realtime & Streaming** | Apache Kafka \+ Materialize OSS | Full streaming stack, very powerful |
| **Observability** | ELK Stack \+ Prometheus \+ Jaeger | Open-source logs, metrics, tracing |
| **Hosting & CI/CD** | Kubernetes (k3s or EKS) \+ Argo CD \+ Terraform | Enterprise-grade infra, IaC, GitOps |

Ops profile: 1–2 FTE; highest infra/maintenance cost; launch in 3–6 months.

**Drawbacks:** Steep operations burden, longer time-to-market.

**Which to choose?**

* **Plan A** gets you live fastest with minimal dev/ops overhead.  
* **Plan B** balances managed services with a bit more flexibility and lower vendor lock-in.  
* **Plan C** gives full autonomy and cost control over the long term—at the price of significant ops investment.
